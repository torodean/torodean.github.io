								This page is a place where I can share sermonettes that I have written. I strive to find biblical principals that are important for society and individuals and try to show their importance by giving real world examples to support them and so others can relate to them and understand them. As with all biblical information and knowledge, these are just learning tools I created. I have tried my best to be accurate and un-biased but it is up to the reader to test all things and look deeper into each of these topics on their own. With all biblical information, you should refer to the Bible and varify that the information is present and contextually accurate. I hope these are helpful study aids and provide a unique perspective that you haven't considered or heard before!

								Seeking Understanding (March 2025)
							</h3>
							<p class="section-description-projects">
								<b>Summary. </b> This message dives into the connection between precise speech and precise understanding. It’s not just about choosing words carefully; it’s about how those words are heard. Jesus showed this with his parables. His words were precise yet veiled, unlocking truth for those ready to hear, but staying shut for others. The difference lies in listening and in seeking clarity through questions. However, being understood isn’t a solo act. It’s easy to see this when some delight more in their own voice than in finding common ground. Proverbs 18:2 cuts right to that. You can aim for clear speech, listen with purpose, ask to understand - but true understanding only comes when both sides move toward each other. Without that, understanding falls apart.

								Mean What You Say (January 2025)
							</h3>
							<p class="section-description-projects">
								<b>Summary. </b>We communicate using words every day, yet misunderstandings remain common. Words have precise meanings, but context and personal experiences influence how they are interpreted. This message focuses on two essential principles for effective communication: "Say what you mean" and "Mean what you say." The first emphasizes precision - words should be clear and unambiguous to prevent misinterpretation. The second stresses integrity - our words should align with our actions to build trust. Using examples from mathematics, biblical references, and daily life, I illustrate how unclear language and inconsistency lead to confusion. True communication requires both clarity and sincerity, ensuring that our words are both understood and trustworthy.

								Apple Seeds (July 2024)
							</h3>
							<p class="section-description-projects">
								<b>Summary. </b>Trust God, not man. This statement is easy to understand but often difficult to live by. We are constantly bombarded with propaganda, information, facts, gossip, and advice. Much of what we hear seems plausible or makes perfect sense, leading us to adjust our lives accordingly. However, do we always critique these messages against God's word? No, we do not. This message examines this concept through the lens of apple seeds, contrasting common criticisms of nature with biblical and scientific perspectives that highlight their benefits and synergistic design.

								Hope In Our Suffering (January 2024)
							</h3>
							<p class="section-description-projects">
								<b>Summary.</b> This paper explores the intriguing connection between recent neuroscience studies and a popular biblical concept related to suffering. While suffering is often viewed with a negative connocation, the examination of a specific brain region, the Anterior MidCingulate Cortex (aMCC), sheds light on its potential benefits. Drawing inspiration from Romans 5:3-4, this message delves into the role of the aMCC in processes such as perseverance, character development, and ultimately, the cultivation of hope. In essence, this message presents a compelling argument for understanding suffering as a catalyst for positive neurological changes, providing a fresh perspective on the biblical scripture.

								The Ultimate Conspirator (December 2023)
							</h3>
							<p class="section-description-projects">
								<b>Summary. </b>In this message, I delve into the realm of conspiracy theories, ranging from seemingly absurd to historically verified. With an emphesis on not dismissing alternative ideas based on a mere label, one can advocate for a descerning approach inspired by biblical principals. Examples, including the flat earth theory and the Phoebus Cartel, illustrate the spectrum of conspiracy theories—from unfounded claims to genuine secret plots. A further exploration ties a global organization to a conspiracy theory involving connections with Satanic influence. This message outlines the need for awareness, demonstrating that conspiracy theories can be cautionary tales that prompt a deeper understanding of unseen forces working around us, echoing the biblical call to be vigilant against spiritual adversaries (Ephesians 6:11-12).

								The Butterfly Effect (October 2023)
							</h3>
							<p class="section-description-projects">
								A few years back, I had a conversation with a friend about how God interacts with the physical reality that we live in. She believed that God constantly interacts, adjusts, intervenes, and monitors reality. On the contrary, I thought it was much more likely that God monitors reality consistently, but only ever needs to make small micro-adjustments. It’s probably a combination of both, but my thoughts on this come from a fundamental branch of mathematics that can be somewhat explored from a biblical perspective. This branch of mathematics is known as chaos theory...</p>

								The Basis Of The Food Laws (July 2023)
							</h3>
							<p class="section-description-projects">
								<b>Summary. </b>This paper delves into the realm of food consumption, with a specific focus on an enigmatic product referred to as "the next best thing to humanity", which was recently approved for sale by the USDA. I advocate of reading food labels, discusses the reasons behind this practice, including the need to be aware of product content and potential deceptive marketing. Drawing parallels to biblical teachings, the paper explores the contrast between the "letter of the law" and the "spirit of the law" and how these concepts apply to God's food laws. An emphasis on the importance of holiness and self-care is explained while examining he potential health implications of consuming certain substances and the relevance of God's food laws in promoting physical well-being. Moreover, the paper urges readers to use their own discernment in determining what may be considered detestable according to biblical principles. The conclusion emphasizes the significance of diligence and self-examination in making informed choices that align with biblical teachings and contribute to personal health and holiness.

								The more stratified a society, the fewer people we have as peers (by definition). Living in one of the most individualistic societies as we do here in America, with capitalism allowing us to climb higher and
								higher on a social and economic ladder, we end up with an endless number of differing social positions
								and hierarchies. With the increased use of social media, we can pick and choose the numerous groups we want to belong to and affiliate with. It’s a system that promotes unlimited individual stratification and gives limited symmetrical and reciprocal relationships which leads to nothing but a lack of altruism. We, as humans, have a fundamental human need for companionship.

								<b>Summary. </b>This message draws an analogy between physical fitness and spiritual growth, emphasizing the importance of consistency in both aspects. It starts with a fitness journey narrative, highlighting the significance of persistent effort to achieve results. Transitioning to the spiritual realm, the paper stresses the need for continuous good deeds and faithful living to become part of God's family. Citing biblical verses, it reinforces the principle of consistency in the scriptures. Drawing parallels with sibling relationships, it underscores the importance of fostering deep connections within the congregation through shared experiences and constant love and care. The paper concludes by encouraging readers not to grow weary of doing good, emphasizing the power of consistency in strengthening the bond of brotherhood and sisterhood within the body of Christ.

								Free Will (2019)
							</h3>
							<p class="section-description-projects">
								<b>Summary.</b> This message begins by addresses the notion that "people are inherently good" and examines the impact of genetic arguments on human behavior. Through thought-provoking examples and scientific evidence, challenges to the belief that behaviors are determined solely by genetics are given. The message delves into the significance of the environment on shaping human actions and decisions, supported by both scientific research and biblical references. The author emphasizes that individuals possess free moral agency, enabling them to choose between blessings and curses, life and death. Drawing from historical events, such as the My Lai Massacre, the message underscores the potential of personal choice in overcoming environmental influences and making virtuous decisions. In conclusion, it is encouraged for readers to look to Christ's example as a guide in discerning environmental influences and consciously choosing life over negative outcomes. By understanding the power of individual choice and the impact of the environment, readers are inspired to enrich their surroundings and make virtuous decisions that align with God's teachings.

							</h3>
							<p class="section-description-projects">
								<b>Summary.</b> I invite readers to imagine a world tainted by greed and suffering, where a small fraction of the population owns a vast majority of the planet's wealth, and thousands of people perish daily due to food insecurity. This message critiques the modern monetary system, particularly fiat currency, which is a fictional creation devoid of inherent value but carries immense significance in society. Through an analogy with the game of Monopoly, one can draw parallels between the pursuit of wealth and the love of money, warning of the destructive consequences of such pursuits. Historical perspectives from figures like John Locke and Adam Smith are examined to shed light on the origin of the current economic system and its inherent flaws. The message presents a case against the love of money and material possessions, urging readers to consider the Kingdom of God as a true alternative, free from suffering and driven by the wisdom of God. Ultimately, the message calls for a shift in perspective and values to envision a world where poverty and greed no longer hold sway, and instead, people focus on what truly matters.
