							<h2 class="text-align-center">About Me</h2>
							<p class="section-description">
								My name is Antonius Torode. I have always tried to be the jack of all trades and if something needs done I enjoy the opportunity to learn to do it myself. I enjoy trying to look at the world around us with a unique perspective. Most of my pre-university knowledge was self taught (Mathematics, programming, video editing, graphic design, etc). While growing up, I always enjoyed chess and anything to do with technology which has given me a good foundation for where I am at now in my career. Eventually I hope to have the opportunity to research at some of the larger universities, or perhaps even in Antarctica (the south pole station has always fascinated me). I will most likely end up teaching at some point in my future, as I have been told I am good at tutoring and helping others understand concepts. 
							</p>
							<p class="section-description">
								My hobbies have always spread over a wide spectrum. In high school I spent a lot of my time dabbling in graphic design and computer sciences. After high school I switched to learning new things like website design and programming. As of recently, I have started to develop a healthier lifestyle through diet and exercise. A lot of my time is spent cooking my own meals, which I try to do for myself and others every day. I have tried to develop a diet that consists of a large variety of whole foods that both tastes good and provides balanced nutrition. I am a large believer in using calisthenics (body weight exercises) to get in shape and so recently I have been training to grow in my capabilities with that.

							<h2 class="text-align-center">Formal Education</h2>
							<p  class="section-description">Growing up I attended Clarkston schools from kindergarten to high school. I was always ahead of the curve when it came to math classes but always at the bottom when it came to grade (from lack of doing homework). At one point I knew I could do better and entered a program called the Clarkston Science Math Technology (<a class="text-link" href="https://chs.clarkston.k12.mi.us/academics/curriculum/csm-tech">CSMTech</a>) program. At the time, I had to skip some minor math and science classes to catch up to the others. I never fell behind in terms of understanding, but my grades stayed relatively low.</p>
							
							<p class="section-description">It was not until college that I decided I should start trying for better grades. I applied to <a class="text-link" href="https://www.oaklandcc.edu/">Oakland Community College (OCC)</a>, where I took many general classes such as composition, anthropology, biology, chemistry, etc. I tried to take as many advanced math classes I could while here which included calculus (I, II and III), differential equations, abstract algebra, engineering physics (I and II) and more. For the most part, my GPA was decent. I had received a 4.0 in my major classes such as calculus III, engineering physics II, chemistry I/II, etc. Unfortunately, early on I received a 2.0 in Engineering Physics I which to this day is still my lowest grade point received in a college class. This was the point where I had decided to major in physics, due to the challenge it would provide me. Before this point I was considering a career in electrical engineering or something similar. Later I found out that even though I had nearly 100 credits taken here, I was one economics class away from an associate’s degree (which was not my goal of attending OCC) when transferring to MSU.</p>
							
							<p class="section-description">After exhausting the interesting classes at OCC, I attended <a class="text-link" href="https://www.msu.edu/">Michigan State University (MSU)</a>. I was originally going to an Astrophysics degree but soon after decided I liked the pure physics classes more. I ended up finishing a physics and mathematics dual degree in 2018 from MSU. I ended up being one class away from the astrophysics degree requirement by the time I finished. I did not pursue this last class because of scheduling conflicts and MSU's policies on receiving a third degree.</p>
							
							<p class="section-description">
								After finishing up my degrees at MSU, I attended a 9 month program at <a class="text-link" href="http://abc.ucg.org/">Ambassador Bible College</a> (ABC) during a long needed break from physics and mathematics classes. While attending ABC I have been learning about the content and history of the Bible while developing my speaking, communication and leadership skills.
							</p>
							<p class="section-description">
								If you're curious as to why someone with my experience has chosen to take almost a year out of my life to attend ABC, the answer is simple. As I enter into my professional career and future, it is pivotal that I have a grounded understanding and foundation for my beliefs. Because of this I have chosen to attend ABC to study the Bible and make sure that I have a firm foundation for my ethics and morals that I want to be sure to live by throughout my life. Along with this, my greatest academic weakness has been my ability to read because this is something I never grew up doing. With that said, I saw no better way to remedy that weakness other than spending the greater part of a year studying the stories and history of the Bible, writing speeches, and being able to enhance my reading comprehension abilities by studying something other than science and mathematics.

								Currently, I am living in Austin Texas where I work for Applied Research Laboratories. When I am not working I am developing my skills through various personal projects. Recently, I have been delving into homesteading and continuing to improve my skills. I have began improving my knowledge about many random subjects including food preservation, woodworking, electrical wiring, circuitry, cooking and much more. I just purchased over 15 acres of land in TN, where I plan to slowly build on over time to learn carpentry skills and eventually provide a place of residence.
